# then using _siftdown to move the oddball originally at index pos into place.
#
# We *could* break out of the loop as soon as we find a pos where newitem <=
# both its children, but turns out that's not a good idea, and despite that
# many books write the algorithm that way.  During a heap pop, the last array
# element is sifted in, and that tends to be large, so that comparing it
# against values starting from the root usually doesn't pay (= usually doesn't
# get us out of the loop early).  See Knuth, Volume 3, where this is
# explained and quantified in an exercise.
#
# Cutting the # of comparisons is important, since these routines have no
# way to extract "the priority" from an array element, so that intelligence
# is likely to be hiding in custom comparison methods, or in array elements
# storing (priority, record) tuples.  Comparisons are thus potentially
# expensive.
#
# On random arrays of length 1000, making this change cut the number of
# comparisons made by heapify() a little, and those made by exhaustive
# heappop() a lot, in accord with theory.  Here are typical results from 3
# runs (3 just to demonstrate how small the variance is):
#
# Compares needed by heapify     Compares needed by 1000 heappops
# --------------------------     --------------------------------
# 1837 cut to 1663               14996 cut to 8680

#
# Building the heap by using heappush() 1000 times instead required
# 2198, 2148, and 2219 compares:  heapify() is more efficient, when
# you can use it.
#
# The total compares needed by list.sort() on the same lists were 8627,

# Theoretical number of comparisons for k smallest of n random inputs:
#
# Step   Comparisons                  Action
# ----   --------------------------   ---------------------------
#  1     1.66 * k                     heapify the first k-inputs
#  2     n - k                        compare remaining elements to top of heap
#  3     k * (1 + lg2(k)) * ln(n/k)   replace the topmost value on the heap
#  4     k * lg2(k) - (k/2)           final sort of the k most extreme values
#
# Combining and simplifying for a rough estimate gives:
#
#        comparisons = n + k * (log(k, 2) * log(n/k) + log(k, 2) + log(n/k))
#
# Computing the number of comparisons for step 3:
# -----------------------------------------------
# * For the i-th new value from the iterable, the probability of being in the
#   k most extreme values is k/i.  For example, the probability of the 101st
#   value seen being in the 100 most extreme values is 100/101.
# * If the value is a new extreme value, the cost of inserting it into the
#   heap is 1 + log(k, 2).
# * The probability times the cost gives:
#            (k/i) * (1 + log(k, 2))
# * Summing across the remaining n-k elements gives:
#            sum((k/i) * (1 + log(k, 2)) for i in range(k+1, n+1))
# * This reduces to:
#            (H(n) - H(k)) * k * (1 + log(k, 2))
# * Where H(n) is the n-th harmonic number estimated by:
#            gamma = 0.5772156649
#            H(n) = log(n, e) + gamma + 1 / (2 * n)
#   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)#Rate_of_divergence
# * Substituting the H(n) formula:
#            comparisons = k * (1 + log(k, 2)) * (log(n/k, e) + (1/n - 1/k) / 2)
#
# Worst-case for step 3:
# ----------------------
# In the worst case, the input data is reversed sorted so that every new element
# must be inserted in the heap:
#
#             comparisons = 1.66 * k + log(k, 2) * (n - k)
#
# Alternative Algorithms
# ----------------------
# Other algorithms were not used because they:
# 1) Took much more auxiliary memory,
# 2) Made multiple passes over the data.
# 3) Made more comparisons in common cases (small k, large n, semi-random input).
# See the more detailed comparison of approach at:
